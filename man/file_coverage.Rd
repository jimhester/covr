\title{Calculate test coverage for sets of files}
\usage{
file_coverage(source_files, test_files, line_exclusions = NULL,
  function_exclusions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{source_files}{Character vector of source files with function
definitions to measure coverage}

\item{test_files}{Character vector of test files with code to test the
functions}

\item{line_exclusions}{a named list of files with the lines to exclude from
each file.}

\item{function_exclusions}{a vector of regular expressions matching function
names to exclude. Example \code{print\\.} to match print methods.}
}
\description{
The files in \code{source_files} are first sourced in to a new environment
to define functions to be checked. Then they are instrumented to track
coverage and the files in the \code{test_files} are sourced.
